Workplace connection software for remote teams

## Design principles
Watercooler is a Reddit clone designed to facilitate the types of workplace chat that draw employees together socially. The project aims to enable chatting about hobbies, discussing the latest bingeable show, holding asynchronous standup meetings, brainstorming future projects, or anything else team members might be passionate about. It is built around the following principles:

### Poll not Push
Distraction free work is critical to being productive in a remote environment. By design, Watercooler gets out of the way by avoiding notifications that pull employees into the service; there are already enough distracting work place tools. Users should go to Watercooler at times that fit their workflow.

### Connection Discovery
Coworkers who work in different spaces have difficulty discovering shared interests. Watercooler seeks to find common interests for employees to bond over.
